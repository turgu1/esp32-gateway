The following files must be adjusted to reflect your environment:

- `include/config.hpp`
- `include/secret.hpp`

Both files are absent from the retrieved project. Vanilla versions of the files are supplied in the`include` folder: `config-dist.hpp` and `secret-dist.hpp`.

This project uses the ESP-IDF framework. Platformio is used to control the compilation process.
